# Hangman-Game
The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where a player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word before the game is over. This Hangman game is built using React and provides a fun and interactive way to play the game.

# Game Rules
The objective of the Hangman game is to guess the secret word by suggesting letters. You can suggest a letter by clicking on the corresponding letter button or by typing the letter on your keyboard. If the secret word contains the letter, it will be revealed in the word. If the secret word does not contain the letter, a part of the hangman will be drawn.

The game is over if you correctly guess the secret word, or if the hangman is fully drawn. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word, so choose your letters carefully!
